# Repository Documentation

#### 1️⃣ Repository Summary

The following repository 'Code_Challenge_Practice' is the culmination of all the Leetcode and HackerRank problems that I have attempted and hopefully completed. Each problem within the repository is complete with their respective title (as documentated in the code challenge platform), the code challenge url, the difficulty (as documented in the code challenge platform) ranging from easy to hard, and my solution's time and space complexity calculation in Big O notation.

Each challenge is separated in their own individual files complete with the solution code (either written in Python and JavaScript), test files (if complicable to the challenge), and challenge specific readme.md file (which includes the rationale behind my solution, a more indepth analysis of the space and time complexity of the solution, and what specific places can be improved if one where to attempt the challenge a second time).

---

### Technologies Used

- Python and JavaScript (specific to the problem or which language I wanted to use to solve the problem).
- unittest and jest testing libraries for solutions written in Python and JavaScript respectively.
